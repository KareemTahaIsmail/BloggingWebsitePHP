This project runs on an apache server because its a pure php back-ended website.
I ran this with the use of a software called XAMPP.
This software allowed me to have my own local apache and mysql servers.

I decided to find a web server host online, and the best free-of charge one was:
000webhost.com

My website URL (Live Server/Demo): https://capstonekat.000webhostapp.com/

NOTE: If the website seems missing what it did on the demo, it's just the slow
      servers.
